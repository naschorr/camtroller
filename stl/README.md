# camtroller
OctoPrint plugin (with CLI) that lets you move and rotate your webcam

## STL Files
It should again be noted that these STL files are mostly designed around the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor, the Raspberry Pi Camera. So you might want roll your own solution if you plan on using a different webcam, or stepper motor. Currently, the "mounting arm.stl" file is designed for a Wanhao Duplicator i3, with the [Z-Brace mod](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:921948).
